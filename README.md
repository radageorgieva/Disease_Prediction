# Acute Liver Failure Prediction

This project aims to illustrate machine learning for medicine as both an enhancement
and a potential solution to racial and gender discrimination in the process of medical
diagnosis. Therefore, I predict the occurance of Acute Liver Failure with target value 1 
if a person experienced the disease, and 0 otherwise. I then compare the performance of 
prediction among the two genders and detect, examine and reduce the underlying gender bias.
